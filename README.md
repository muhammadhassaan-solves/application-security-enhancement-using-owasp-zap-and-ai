<h1>Application Security Enhancement Using OWASP ZAP and AI</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I developed an AI-driven vulnerability prediction system that processes security scan data, applies machine learning models, and accurately identifies high-risk vulnerabilities. This project enhances threat detection, automates security analysis, and strengthens proactive cybersecurity measures.
<br />



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Python:</strong> For data preprocessing, machine learning model development (using scikit-learn, joblib, and pandas), and automation of vulnerability prediction.</li> <li><strong>Batch Scripting:</strong> To integrate and automate the entire workflow, including triggering scans and processing reports.</li> <li><strong>OWASP ZAP:</strong> As the primary security scanning tool to generate scan reports.</li></ul>
